Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
Conducted EDA on Olympic Games data to explore historical trends in participation, performance, and medal distribution across countries and events.
Cleaned and transformed the dataset by handling missing values, filtering inconsistent records, and encoding categorical data for analysis.
Visualized key patterns such as country-wise medal counts, gender participation over time, and sport-wise dominance using bar plots, line graphs, and heatmaps.
Analyzed trends across multiple editions of the Olympics to identify top-performing nations, emerging sports, and participation disparities.
Derived insights on medal trends, athlete demographics, and evolution of sports events, supporting data-driven storytelling and presentation.
